    abstract = { Bridging cultures that have often been distant, Julia combines expertise from the diverse fields of computer science and computational science to create a new approach to numerical computing. Julia is designed to be easy and fast and questions notions generally held to be “laws of nature" by practitioners of numerical computing: \beginlist \item High-level dynamic programs have to be slow. \item One must prototype in one language and then rewrite in another language for speed or deployment. \item There are parts of a system appropriate for the programmer, and other parts that are best left untouched as they have been built by the experts. \endlist We introduce the Julia programming language and its design---a dance between specialization and abstraction. Specialization allows for custom treatment. Multiple dispatch, a technique from computer science, picks the right algorithm for the right circumstance. Abstraction, which is what good computation is really about, recognizes what remains the same after differences are stripped away. Abstractions in mathematics are captured as code through another technique from computer science, generic programming. Julia shows that one can achieve machine performance without sacrificing human convenience. }

    abstract = {In this paper trade-offs among certain computational factors in hash coding are analyzed. The paradigm problem considered is that of testing a series of messages one-by-one for membership in a given set of messages. Two new hash-coding methods are examined and compared with a particular conventional hash-coding method. The computational factors considered are the size of the hash area (space), the time required to identify a message as a nonmember of the given set (reject time), and an allowable error frequency.The new methods are intended to reduce the amount of space required to contain the hash-coded information from that associated with conventional methods. The reduction in space is accomplished by exploiting the possibility that a small fraction of errors of commission may be tolerable in some applications, in particular, applications in which a large amount of data is involved and a core resident hash area is consequently not feasible using conventional methods.In such applications, it is envisaged that overall performance could be improved by using a smaller core resident hash area in conjunction with the new methods and, when necessary, by using some secondary and perhaps time-consuming test to “catch” the small fraction of errors associated with the new methods. An example is discussed which illustrates possible areas of application for the new methods.Analysis of the paradigm problem demonstrates that allowing a small number of test messages to be falsely identified as members of the given set will permit a much smaller hash area to be used without increasing reject time.},

    abstract = "{Adaptive immunity is driven by the expansion, somatic hypermutation, and selection of B cell clones. Each clone is the progeny of a single B cell responding to Ag, with diversified Ig receptors. These receptors can now be profiled on a large scale by next-generation sequencing. Such data provide a window into the microevolutionary dynamics that drive successful immune responses and the dysregulation that occurs with aging or disease. Clonal relationships are not directly measured, but they must be computationally inferred from these sequencing data. Although several hierarchical clustering-based methods have been proposed, they vary in distance and linkage methods and have not yet been rigorously compared. In this study, we use a combination of human experimental and simulated data to characterize the performance of hierarchical clustering-based methods for partitioning sequences into clones. We find that single linkage clustering has high performance, with specificity, sensitivity, and positive predictive value all \\&gt;99\\%, whereas other linkages result in a significant loss of sensitivity. Surprisingly, distance metrics that incorporate the biases of somatic hypermutation do not outperform simple Hamming distance. Although errors were more likely in sequences with short junctions, using the entire dataset to choose a single distance threshold for clustering is near optimal. Our results suggest that hierarchical clustering using single linkage with Hamming distance identifies clones with high confidence and provides a fully automated method for clonal grouping. The performance estimates we develop provide important context to interpret clonal analysis of repertoire sequencing data and allow for rigorous testing of other clonal grouping algorithms.}",

We characterized mAb genetic features by sequence assignments to the donors’ personal immunoglobulin genotypes and assessed antibody neutralizing activities against ancestral SARS-CoV-2, Beta, Delta, and Omicron variants. The mAbs used a broad range of immunoglobulin heavy chain (IGH) V genes in the response to all sub-determinants of the spike examined, with similar characteristics observed in both donors. IGH repertoire sequencing and B cell lineage tracing at longitudinal time points revealed extensive evolution of SARS-CoV-2 spike-binding antibodies from acute infection until vaccination five months later. These results demonstrate that highly polyclonal repertoires of affinity-matured memory B cells were efficiently recalled by vaccination, providing a basis for the potent antibody responses observed in convalescent persons following vaccination.},

Rhesus and cynomolgus macaques are important animal models for pre-clinical studies, with four main sub-groups being used: Indian- and Chinese-origin rhesus macaques and Mauritian and Indonesian cynomolgus macaques. We applied the (Ig) gene inference tool IgDiscover and performed extensive Sanger sequencing-based genomic validation to define germline VDJ alleles in these 4 sub-groups, comprising 45 macaques in total. There was allelic overlap between Chinese- and Indian-origin rhesus macaques and also between the two macaque species, which is consistent with substantial admixture. The island-restricted Mauritian cynomolgus population displayed the lowest number of alleles of the sub-groups, yet maintained high individual allelic diversity. These comprehensive databases of germline IGH alleles for rhesus and cynomolgus macaques provide a resource toward the study of B cell responses in these important pre-clinical models.},
